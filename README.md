# HackDuke - Running the project

To run the project first create your own virtual environment (We have also already provided one so you can cd into the Scripts folder and  source ./activate to instantiate the venv we have provided). Then you want to cd into our hackduke2020 folder to where all the python scripts are included such as __init__.py, main.py, etc. Then you just do export FLASK_APP=__init__.py and then flask run to open the local host webpage.
